# Why this app exist?

I can't find a light weight typescript UI that I can use to code typescript locally without depending on internet (i.e. on airplane, subway, basement, etc) So I made this app for the future me and whoever may need it as well.

I mainly use this to do algorithm practices. But feel free to use this to suit your need or definitely contribute to make this better if you found of this little boi!

# Requirements

Node JS v18.13.0+
[Recommended] To use this together with VSCode to take advantage of the default typescript setup. (Because, well, that's how I use this app :P)

# How to start coding in typescript with this project

1. configure which file to watch for with nodejs in the `./run.sh file` if you want to use a different file name than `./src/algorithm.js`
2. then from then on, just type `./run.sh` should start your build and compiling process automatically.
3. you may start coding inside `./src/algorithm.ts` to see compiled result in terminal as well as see your compiled version javascript file as `./src/algorithm.js`.

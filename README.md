# How to start coding in typescript with this project

1. configure which file to watch for with nodejs in the `./run.sh file` if you want to use a different file name than `./src/algorithm.js`
2. then from then on, just type `./run.sh` should start your build and compiling process automatically.
3. you may start coding inside `./src/algorithm.ts` to see compiled result in terminal as well as see your compiled version javascript file as `./src/algorithm.js`.
